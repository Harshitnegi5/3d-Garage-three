# 3D Garage 🚗  

Welcome to **3D Garage**, a 3D landing page built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This project showcases **3D models of garage**, allowing users to explore them interactively. With the help of **GLTFLoader** for loading models and **OrbitControls** for navigation, the 3D Garage is designed to be intuitive and visually stunning.  

---

## Features ✨  

- 🌟 **Interactive 3D environment**.  
- 🚗 **High-quality 3D car models** loaded using the GLTF format.  
- 🌀 **Smooth navigation** with OrbitControls.  
- 🎨 **Easy-to-customize scene elements** (lighting, background, etc.).

## Dependencies 📦  

The following libraries power this project:  

### 🔷 **Three.js**  
Three.js is the **core 3D rendering library** that powers the 3D Garage. It provides tools to create and render **3D scenes**, objects, and animations.  
- 📖 [Official Documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/)  

### 📁 **GLTFLoader**  
A loader for importing 3D models in **GLTF** or **GLB** format into your Three.js scene. This ensures lightweight, efficient, and standardized 3D models.  
- 📚 [Learn about GLTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)  

### 🌀 **OrbitControls**  
A utility for enabling user interaction, such as **rotating**, **zooming**, and **panning** the camera around the scene. Perfect for creating an **interactive experience**.  
- 🔗 [OrbitControls Docs](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls)  

These dependencies are included via [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) in the `index.html` file, so there's **no need to install them manually**. 


## Tips for Better Results 💡  

- 🛠️ **Optimize Models**: Use compressed GLTF/GLB files to improve loading times. Tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) can help.  
- 📱 **Test on Devices**: Ensure the scene is responsive and performs well on both desktops and mobile devices.  
- ⚡ **Reduce Render Load**: Limit the number of objects or use low-polygon models to maintain high frame rates.  
- 💡 **Experiment with Lighting**: Proper lighting can drastically improve the realism of your scene. Try combining ambient, directional, and point lights.

## Future Enhancements 🌟  

- 🖼️ **Add a UI for switching between multiple car models**.  
- 🚪 **Implement animations for opening/closing car doors**.  
- 🎨 **Include more interactive features** like color customization for car parts.
